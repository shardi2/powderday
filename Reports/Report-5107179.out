Lmod is automatically replacing "mvapich2/2.3.6-ouywal" with "openmpi/4.1.4".

Additional features and improved performance (usually) by saving this arbor with "save_arbor" and reloading:
	>>> a = ytree.load("/storage/home/hcoda1/0/jw254/data/SG64-2020/rockstar_halos-jhw/trees/tree_0_0_0.dat")
	>>> fn = a.save_arbor()

Getting Help
**********

Please feel free to file an issue on the `github page
<https://github.com/dnarayanan/powderday/issues?`_ if you have an
issue or even a simple use question!  We will tag and sort them
appropriately.  This issue tracker will serve as a repository for old
questions as well.

If a run crashes, it can oftentimes be very useful to post your
parameters files as well as include which hash you're working off of.
You can recover the hash by typing::

  >git rev-parse HEAD

And similarly, if you want a neat way to create a link out of your
parameters files, you can type::

  >yt pastebin parameters_master.py
  >yt pastebin parmaeters_model.py

and two separate links will be created with the parameters files.
(Sometimes the pasting will fail on the first attempt but work on a
second attempt)
